        <p>APNA COLLEGE has been set up, keeping in mind the ideals of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, whose contribution to the Indian Freedom Movement remains invaluable forever. Netaji had dreamt of vibrant, strong and powerful India, an India which would be independent and self reliant, not only politically, but also in the spheres of Education & Technology. He strongly believed that true independence can only stem from strong base in education and technology.</p>

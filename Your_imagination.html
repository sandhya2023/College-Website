        <h2 style="color:darkgreen">Training and Placement Overview</h2>
        <p>The Placement Cell plays a crucial role in locating job opportunities for Under Graduates and Post Graduates passing out from the college by keeping in touch with reputed firms and industrial establishments. The Placement Cell operates round the year to facilitate contacts between companies and graduates. The number of students placed through the campus interviews is continuously.  On invitation, many reputed industries visit the institute to conduct interviews.We have been successful in maintaining our high placement statistics over the years and the fact that our students bear the recession blues with record breaking placements itself is a testimony to our quality. Our ingenious alumnae have set new standards in the corporate world through their estimable contributions and it is my firm conviction that we will continue that legacy in the years to come.</p>
        <h2  style="color:darkgreen">Aptitude & Soft Skill Training</h2>
        <p>Soft Skills relate to the sociological development of what is referred to as EQ – a person’s Emotional Quotient, commonly known as Emotional Intelligence. These skills allow an individual to build relationships with others by leveraging their unique personality traits, social aptitude, communication expertise, inclusiveness and respect for others. Soft Skills are the set of skills that a person should possess in order to face life's daily challenges successfully and to positively adapt to it. This would build the self confidence in an individual to handle life challenges in a more effective manner.</p>
